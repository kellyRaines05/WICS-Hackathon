# APP NAME HERE

Welcome to APP NAME HERE! [APP NAME] is an Android application built in Expo and JavaScript. [APP NAME] aims to help neurodivergent people who struggle with maintaining friendships by putting social initiative in the palm of their hand. This app manages a list of friends the user wishes to maintain and stores important information the user wants to keep track of. Whether the user is looking for a birthdate, favorite food, or phone number, they will be able to find it on [APP NAME]. This application also provides regular nudges to communicate with friends! This app gives reminders to speak with particular friends based on user settings and even helps the user come up with something to say. [APP NAME] tracks how often the user speaks with particular friends to ensure that they donâ€™t accidentally neglect the people who are important to them.
